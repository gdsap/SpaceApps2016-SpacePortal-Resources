Space Portal

MOTIVATION :

1. One-Stop Solution to all queries about Space.
2. Comprehensive Information through Intuitive UI.
3. Creating Awareness amongst masses.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

A collaborative portal that allows users to know everything about space at one single place. We are focusing on root level problems that includes social impact, awareness and knowledge sharing. We have taken this responsibility to enable users by space terminologies beacause we see there is a huge gap in that by providing all the information in a single place.

Using "Space Portal" you can collaborate with the people having same likes, add and locate exact data that can help the users to know more about the location keeping space, diseases, and all the things that have a social impact. Find experts from the topics that interest you (black hole, time travel etc) and benefit from their knowledge.

It helps to leverage this rich data and then provide a single place where the user can access, learn and manipulate it. We have learning hub where the content all over the sphere is kept and based on the age limit it's shown so you have a single stop solution for everything related to space. Taking you out of the sphere while being on it.

This portal is up and running with features in beta. Cheers !!
